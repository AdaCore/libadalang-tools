  This test verifies that marshalling remains functional with test cases dumped
  by gnattest.

  It proceeds as follows:

  1.  Execute gnattest to generate and dump test inputs.
  2.  Employ a custom driver to create JSON-free TGen support packages.
  3.  Build and run tests using the "light" marshalling_lib.

driver: shell_script
