description:
  Check that TGen properly rejects constrained array types which are over the

  We do this by attempting to generate tests with gnattest for a big array type,
  and checking the emitted warnings.

driver: gnattest_driver

control:
    - [XFAIL, 'x86', 'Marshalling not working for 32bits (UB03-008)']
