description:
  An error message should be emitted when a test subdir name is specified
  (either throught --subdir or the Subdir gnattest project attribute) along
  with a source directory path ending in "**" in the project file.
  This is to avoid gnattest seeing a previouly generated test subdirectory
  as a source directory when ran twice in row.
