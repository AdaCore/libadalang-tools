  Verify that using a type from a predefined specification generates
  a valid TGen and GNATtest harness without use clauses in the
  child packages specification. Child packages of predefined packages are also
  considered predefined. Therefore, as use clauses are not permitted
  in predefined specifications, none should be present in the generated
  specification.
