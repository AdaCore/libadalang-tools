description:
  Test that the UTF-8 encoding defined by the BOM in some sources does
  not override the default encoding for all the other sources. This otherwise
  results in paring errors from LAL.

  The pkg.* sources in this test contain a BOM specifying UTF-8 encoding, which
  used to cause the LAL context to be created with UTF-8 encoding by default.
  This behavior was incorrect (default encoding should only be modified by the
  -W switch), and prevented other Latin-1 source containing non-ASCII
  characters from being recognized. This is materialized in zdep.*, which
  contain a 'Ã©' character, encoded in latin-1.
