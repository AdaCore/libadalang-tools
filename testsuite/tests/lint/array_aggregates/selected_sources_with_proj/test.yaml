title: selected_sources_with_proj

description: |4
    Tests that array aggregates can process the --sources,-S and --project,-P
    switches that defines the set of files to be refactored. The difference of
    this test to the "selected_sources" one is that by passing the -P switch,
    a common analysis context is created and used to analyse all sources.
    This leads to not missing any case since we're able to resolve the
    expression type of all aggregates.
