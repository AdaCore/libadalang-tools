    This test checks if the safe rename tool correctly handles different kinds
    of packages used on a Use_Package_Clause. The kinds of packages tested by
    this test are: Package_Decl, Package_Renaming_Decl and
    Generic_Package_Instantiation.
    A use clause with multiple packages separated by a comma is also tested.
