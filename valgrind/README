To run the test suite under valgrind on Linux, put
this directory on your PATH before libadalang-tools/bin.
The testsuite.py script will then find the scripts
in this directory, which run the "real" versions
under valgrind.

Tests run almost 40 times slower, so you might
need to change the TIMEOUT.
