package Pp.Buffers is

   --  This package supports a character Buffer type, and a Marker type that
   --  can be used to point at particular characters. The main feature of
   --  this abstraction is that Markers are automatically kept up to date
   --  as modifications are made. For example, suppose the buffer Buf contains:
   --
   --     "Hello, world."
   --      123456789 123
   --           ^   ^
   --  and we have two Markers, one pointing at Buf(6) = ',' and the other
   --  pointing at Buf(10) = 'r'. Suppose the insertion point is at Buf(8) =
   --  'w', meaning insertions will occur before that character. If we insert
   --  "***", we will then have:
   --
   --     "Hello, ***world."
   --      123456789 123456
   --           ^      ^
   --  Note that the second Mark has "moved" so that it still points at the
   --  'r'.
   --
   --  The basic idea is to move through the buffer (see procedure
   --  Move_Forward), inserting text at various places (see procedure Insert).
   --  When we get to the end, we can call Reset to move back to the beginning.

   type Buffer is limited private;
   --  Initially empty. A buffer has a current insertion point, called 'point',
   --  which is initially at position 1.

   type Marker is new Positive;
   --  A Marker is a pointer to a particular character in the buffer. Note that
   --  a Marker is valid only for a particular Buffer; it cannot be used to
   --  refer to a different Buffer, nor can it be used after Clear.
   --
   --  Type Marker should really be private, but Ada has an annoying
   --  restriction that would disallow package Marker_Vectors below, so we
   --  expose the fact that it's an integer. You shouldn't be doing arithmetic
   --  and the like on it outside this package. "=" comparisons are OK.

   --  The concept of markers that automatically track buffer changes comes
   --  from Emacs. The implementation here is not based on Emacs.

   --  Markers are logically updated on every insertion. The "obvious"
   --  implementation, which we don't use because it's grossly inefficient,
   --  is as follows: Store the characters in a Vector, and store the markers
   --  in another vector, each marker having the index of the corresponding
   --  character. When inserting a character, we would have to shove all the
   --  characters to the right of 'point' one position to the right. We would
   --  also have to shove all the markers to the right of 'point' one position
   --  to the right, and increment their index.
   --
   --  So we don't do that.
   --
   --  The actual implementation is set up so we don't have to loop through
   --  all the characters and Markers to the right of the 'point' every time we
   --  do an insertion. Instead, we update each Marker just once on each pass
   --  through the buffer. These updates are done when moving forward, not
   --  when inserting text (except in one minor case: insertion just before
   --  a marker).
