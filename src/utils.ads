   Main_Done : Boolean := False;
   --  This is set True at the (successful) end of each main procedure. The
   --  purpose is so assertions in Finalize operations can tell whether the
   --  main procedure exited normally. See, for example,

   --  which should be reported normally.

   Syntax_Errors : Boolean := False;
   --  This is set True if one of the analyzed source files has syntax errors.
   --  The purpose is to set a proper Exit Code at the end of the execution.
